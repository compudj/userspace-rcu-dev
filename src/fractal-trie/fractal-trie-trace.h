 * no exclusion covered.  Whether that cost anything cannot be measured FROM A
 * TEST: the only observable is "the returned node is not on the key's chain",
 * and a peer may legitimately remove the key between the call and the check, so
 * the count mixes the defect with a benign race.  ☠ AND THE COARSE ARM DOES NOT
 * DISCRIMINATE IT -- the FT-wide lock serialises the TEST'S OWN follow-up walk
 * too (the peer must be woken and scheduled after the release), so coarse draws
 * a near-zero for a reason that has nothing to do with the verdict.  A control
 * that differs from the arm in more ways than the one being measured is not a
 * control.
 *
 * The honest instrument lives INSIDE the op, where the question is decided under
 * the holder lock and the answer cannot change under it: compare the capture
 * against the re-read the walk already performs.  A mismatch, or a retired
 * capture, means the verdict taken at the OLD position WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG --
 * and that is a fact, not a sample.  Costs one increment on a path that is
 * already aborting.

 * FAST STOP.  `lttng stop` is a round trip to the session daemon and
 * `lttng snapshot record` a fork+exec -- MILLISECONDS.  On a workload emitting
 * millions of events per second a 64 KiB ring wraps many times over in that
 * window, so a violation site that calls them directly dumps a snapshot from
 * which its own violation event has already been evicted.  (Measured: 6
 * snapshots, 0 violation events in any of them.)
 *
 * So freeze emission in-process FIRST, with a single relaxed store, and only
 * then pay for the slow calls.  Every emitter checks the flag, so the ring stops
 * advancing within a store-buffer drain of the violation instead of within a
 * process spawn.
 *
 * ORDER AT THE SITE: emit the violation, THEN freeze -- the violation must be
 * the last event IN the buffer, not the first one dropped by its own flag.
 *
 * SINGLE-PROCESS ONLY, and that is exactly the case here: the flag is
 * process-local, so it silences this process's emitters and no others.  A
 * multi-process session still needs `lttng stop` to freeze its peers, which is
 * why the slow path stays.
 *
 * RELAXED is deliberate.  This is not ordering data -- it is a "stop shouting"
 * hint whose only requirement is to become visible fast; on x86 a relaxed store
 * lands in tens of nanoseconds, and a straggler event or two from a thread that

 * with peers it is a hypothesis the event's @nr_writers lets the reader judge.
 *
 * The rekey writer already had a private version of this (FT_DEBUG_REKEY_RETRY_

 * GENERIC -- insert, remove, replace and rekey share it -- and made TRACEABLE:
 * instead of only printing, it fires an LTTng violation event, records the
 * flight-recorder snapshot, and aborts, so the window that led to the spin is
 * on disk instead of being overwritten by the spin itself.
 *
 * ☞ IT IS PER OP, NOT PER THREAD.  Reset at every entry: a thread that does a
 * million ordinary mutations must not accumulate its way into a false positive,
 * and the question is always "did THIS call converge".
 *
 * The cap is deliberately far above real contention -- a saturated multi-writer
 * arm re-attempts in single digits, so five figures cannot be a peer.
