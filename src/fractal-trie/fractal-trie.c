 *
 * Userspace RCU library - Fractal Trie
 *
 * ===================== High-level architecture =====================
 *
 * The Fractal Trie is a concurrent, RCU-protected ordered map from
 * opaque byte keys to application-owned nodes.  Lookups and ordered
 * traversals are wait-free under the RCU read-side lock and run
 * concurrently with mutations; writers are serialized by a
 * caller-provided mutex.  The public contract (semantics, guarantees,
 * locking rules, error codes) lives in <urcu/fractal-trie.h>; this
 * comment is the implementation map.
 *
 * Source layout
 * -------------
 *   fractal-trie.c          core: read descent; point / range / rank
 *                           lookups; ordered iteration; insert / remove /
 *                           replace; the bulk ops; compaction.
 *   fractal-trie-internal.h struct layouts, tagged-pointer encodings, the
 *                           node-type table, and inline helpers.
 *   fractal-trie-alloc.c    the strided internal-node allocator and the
 *                           external (leaf) buddy arena.
 *   urcu-flip-latch.h       the atomic multi-pointer "flip" primitive
 *                           used to commit a set of edges at once.
 *
 * Node model
 * ----------
 * Internal nodes self-adapt to child density: cascaded popcount bitmaps
 * for small / medium fan-out and a 256-entry "pigeon" array for dense
 * nodes, sized in powers of two.  The node type / configuration is
 * encoded in the low (tag) bits of the child pointer, so the read path
 * dispatches with no extra load.  External (leaf) nodes are
 * application-owned (they embed struct cds_ft_node); same-key duplicates
 * form a next-linked chain off the head.
 *
 * Path compression
 * ----------------
 * Single-child chains collapse into compressed (Patricia / ART-style)
 * nodes that store the shared bytes inline.  On 64-bit arches with free
 * high pointer bits, the "skip-compressed" encoding packs the skip
 * length and child pointer into the parent slot, so a speculative
 * descent bypasses the compressed node's cache line entirely
 * (FEATURE_FT_SKIP_COMPRESSED; -DNO_FEATURE_FT_COMPRESS disables
 * compression altogether).
 *
 * Memory layout
 * -------------
 * The internal-node allocator strides item data and metadata onto
 * separate cache lines, so the read hot path touches only the dense item
 * region -- which is why resident memory overstates the cache-hot
 * working set (see fractal-trie-alloc.c).  Internal nodes are reclaimed
 * via call_rcu.
 *
 * Ordered iteration
 * -----------------
 * When enabled (the default), the library threads the duplicate-chain
 * heads into a key-ordered list of small library-owned "ordinal cells",
 * kept off the descent hot path; cds_ft_next / cds_ft_prev and the
 * batched cell walk step that list.  Disabling it
 * (cds_ft_group_attr_set_ordered_list false) drops the per-key cell for
 * lower memory and faster mutations, at the cost of ordered iteration.
 *
 * Read descent
 * ------------
 * Two descent encodings per group (enum cds_ft_lookup_optimization):
 * SPECULATIVE skips per-node byte comparison and returns a candidate the
 * caller (or the speculative-lookup wrapper) validates; EAGER compares
 * exactly at each step.  Both return verified results.  Inequality and
 * rank / skip queries use per-node key counters to skip whole subtrees
 * in O(depth).  Going back up -- for next / prev / remove and for key
 * reconstruction -- follows parent back-pointers (and the cell list for
 * ordered walks) rather than a recorded descent path.
 *
 * Mutation and concurrency model
 * ------------------------------
 * Writers are serialized by a caller-provided mutex (CDS_FT_SCOPED_WRITER
 * only VALIDATES that exclusion; it is not itself a lock).  Every change
 * to published state follows a build-invisibly -> publish -> reclaim
 * discipline: a new node cluster is assembled where readers cannot reach
 * it, made visible by a single release store (or, for a multi-edge
 * commit such as a non-empty merge, one urcu-flip-latch commit that flips
 * all affected edges at once), and the displaced nodes are freed after a
 * grace period.  A reader therefore always observes a complete
 * prior-or-result state, never a partial one.  The discipline is spelled
 * out in the rcu-mutation rules and checked by the verify-at-mutation
 * build option (-DFEATURE_FT_VERIFY_AT_MUTATION).
 *
 * The bulk ops (graft, graft-swap, detach, merge, merge_at) move or
 * combine whole sub-tries between tries of one group; the union cases
 * spine-copy the overlap and commit through the flip latch.  A trie is
 * either exclusive (no concurrent readers; reclaim is synchronous and a
 * source graft skips its drain) or concurrent (RCU readers permitted).
 *
 * Reclamation
 * -----------
 * Deferred frees go through call_rcu; a fully-drained allocator range
 * releases its pages (MADV_DONTNEED on Linux) from inside the callback.
 * cds_ft_compact relocates live nodes into dense fresh ranges to recover
 * fragmentation; the emptied ranges reclaim after a grace period.
