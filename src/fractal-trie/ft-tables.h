/*
 * Node-size tiers (the ft_types[] arrays below) and the tag budget that
 * bounds them.
 *
 * Each node carries a type index naming its tier: the [min_child, max_child]
 * child-count range it serves, its type class, and its size order (node size
 * == 1 << order bytes).  Picking a tier on add/remove is NOT a search of the
 * array: find_nearest_type_index() STEPS from the node's current tier to the
 * adjacent one -- up one tier when a child add exceeds max_child, down one when
 * a remove drops below min_child -- so the common +/- 1-child change moves at
 * most one tier (it loops further only when the child count jumps by more).
 * Each tier's min_child overlaps the previous tier's max_child: an intentional
 * hysteresis that damps reallocation under cyclic add/remove within a node.
 * The top tier has max_child == 256 (a full node); the bottom tier (index 0)
 * holds the smallest nodes, including the 0-child root that is kept alive.
 *
 * The type index is carried in 3 bits of the node pointer's low tag bits, so
 * it has 8 possible values: the real tiers plus NODE_INDEX_NULL (the absent /
 * pruned-node sentinel) -- indices 0..6 real + 7 == NULL on 64-bit, 0..5 real
 * + 6 == NULL on 32-bit.  The full pointer-tag scheme (canonical masks in
 * fractal-trie-internal.h: FT_INTERNAL_MASK / FT_COMPRESSED_MASK) is:
 *
 *   bit0 = 0, bit1 = 0   external (leaf) pointer, or NULL
 *   bit0 = 0, bit1 = 1   compressed (path) node
 *   bit0 = 1             internal node; bits 1-3 carry the 3-bit type index
 *
 * Internal nodes spend the most tag bits -- 1 (internal/external flag) + 3
 * (type index) = 4 low bits -- so every node must be 16-byte aligned to keep
 * those bits free for the tag.  That is why the smallest usable allocation
 * order is 4 (node size 1 << 4 == 16 bytes); compressed and external pointers
 * fit within the same 4-bit budget (bit 1 set, and 0b00, respectively).
 */

/*
 * The popcount scanners hardcode the pointer offset that matches
 * their header layout (scan_16_16_max_3 at +8, scan_16_16_max_5 at
 * +12, scan_32_8 / scan_64_4 at +16, popcount_1l at +32), and
 * access pointers via sizeof(void *) stride.  Both offsets and
 * strides remain valid on 32-bit pointers, so the scanners
 * themselves are pointer-size agnostic.  What differs is per-node
 * capacity: 32-bit pointers leave trailing space, and large bp_1l
 * nodes can fit substantially more children for the same node size
 * (the 32 B bitmap header is fixed).  The 32-bit ft_types[] below
 * tunes max_child accordingly.
 *
 * Two-level popcount bitmap.  A node's child-presence bitmap (which of the
 * up-to-256 child slots are occupied) is stored two-level so that mapping an
 * occupied slot to its dense child-pointer index costs a couple of popcounts
 * rather than a scan: a ROOT bitmap (root_bm) sits over a row of SUB-bitmaps
 * (sub_bm).  Each sub_bm holds the presence bits for one contiguous block of
 * slots; the corresponding root_bm bit is set iff that sub_bm has any child.
 * A slot's index is then popcount(sub_bm below the slot) plus the children in
 * all lower non-empty sub-bitmaps (the root_bm summarizes which to add).
 *
 * Layout naming: scan_<root_bits>_<sub_bm_bits>(_max_<N>) -- e.g. scan_16_16
 * is a 16-bit root_bm over 16-bit sub_bms (16 x 16 = 256 slots).  The
 * trailing _max_<N> appears only on the generic-2L variants
 * (scan_16_16_*) where the ptr offset depends on the static
 * sub_bm[] tail length (max_child).  The flat-layout scanners split the
 * 8-bit slot index (a byte) into a high field that selects the root_bm
 * entry and a low field that selects the bit within the sub_bm -- a "5+3
 * byte-split" is 5 high bits + 3 low bits, etc.  scan_32_8 uses a 5+3
 * byte-split with u8 nibbles; scan_64_4 a 6+2 byte-split with u4 nibbles.
 * Both pack root_bm + packed_bms into a fixed 12 B or 16 B header, so the
 * ptr offset is constant (+16 after alignment) and one function serves
 * multiple max_child values.
 *
 * 32-bit max_child tuning: the flat scanners (scan_32_8, scan_64_4)
 * are layout-only -- headers do not grow with max_child and packed_bms
 * supports up to 64 distinct (hi, lo) pairs.  On 32-bit ptrs,
 * scan_64_4 hosts max_child=12 in 64 B and max_child=16 in 128 B (the
 * latter is bitmap-bound; trailing 48 B is layout slack).  The
 * layout helpers (header_bytes, get_nr_child, get_ith_pos,
 * set_nth) accept all canonical max_child values; the dispatcher
 * routes by max_child.
 *
 * scan_16_16_max_3 stays at max_child=3 on both arches: the 8 B header
 * packs root_bm + 3 sub_bm exactly and cannot grow without changing
 * the load shape.  scan_16_16_max_5 (32-bit only) extends the same
 * generic 2L layout with two extra sub_bm slots so the 12 B header
 * + 5 x 4 B ptrs fills the 32 B order-5 node exactly.
