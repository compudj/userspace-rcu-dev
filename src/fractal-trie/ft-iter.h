 *
 * Self-diagnosing form of the parent-word assert below.  The bare assert says
 * only THAT a parent read is illegal; at -O1 every local naming WHICH node
 * produced it is optimized out of the core, so the interesting half -- the node
 * whose @parent_word yielded the bad value, i.e. the one suspected of having
 * been freed while still referenced -- is unrecoverable.  Dump it at the point
 * of detection instead, where the walk is still live.
 *
 * @from is that node (NULL when the bad value came from @cell->parent itself).
 * The two words at @bad are printed raw because a metadata slot returned to its
 * range freelist has @free_list_next over @parent_word, so a stale parent read
 * lands on a struct cds_ft_metadata_alloc whose rcu_head is {next, func}: a
 * @bad[1] that symbolizes to cds_ft_free_item_rcu is the freed-item signature.
 * Symbolize offline -- that callback is static to fractal-trie-alloc.c.
 *
 * The dump names the node whose parent_word was clobbered, but the DANGLING
 * LINK is one level BELOW that -- on the last node still alive, which is what
 * has to be explained.  @hist therefore carries each level so the live -> freed
 * boundary is visible in the dump instead of inferred from it.
 *
 * Naming the boundary is still not naming the STALE EDGE: a live node whose
 * parent_word reaches a freed node is equally consistent with (a) a retire that
 * missed this child's back-pointer and (b) a back-pointer that was never stale
 * at all, because the node ABOVE it was itself freed and reallocated under the
 * link that reached it.  The two are told apart by the FORWARD edge: the slot
 * that this node's own (parent, PSO) pair derives must hold this very node.
 * The DEEPEST level whose slot does NOT hold it is where the structure first
 * disagrees with itself, and the level below that names the op to look at.
