# ft_parallel_gate.sh -- build + run the fractal-trie TAP suites
# (test_urcu_ft_unit and test_urcu_ft_inv) across every feature-flag
# configuration CONCURRENTLY, as a pre-commit gate.
#
# Why a separate tree per config:
#   The feature flags (verify-at-mutation, skip-compress off, compress
#   off, fault-inject + tombstone-audit, insert-in-place) are compile
#   time -D defines.  A single in-tree build can only hold one set at a
#   time (and an out-of-tree build is refused while the source is
#   configured), so a sequential "clean; rebuild; test" per config
#   serializes the whole matrix behind the slowest leg (VAM).  Instead
#   we keep one CONFIGURED copy of the source tree per config under
#   $FT_GATE_DIR and build+test them all at once.
#
#   The flags are applied at CONFIGURE time (CPPFLAGS=... ./configure),
#   not via a make-time `make CPPFLAGS=` override: the override reaches
#   the library but NOT the test-side #ifdefs (e.g. VAM's skip of the
#   O(keys^2) test_compact_dense_full_node), which would silently build
#   the tests as default and mis-report coverage.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/regression/ft_parallel_gate.sh [config ...]
#     no args   -- run the full matrix
#     config... -- run only the named configs (default fault-audit vam
#                  noskip nocompress in-place)
#
# Env:
#   FT_GATE_DIR  per-config tree copies live here   (default:
#                $HOME/.cache/ft-parallel-gate -- OUTSIDE the repo so the
#                GB of copies never pollute git status)
#
#                ☠ AND NOT UNDER /tmp, WHICH IS A tmpfs ON THIS CLASS OF
#                BOX.  The matrix keeps one CONFIGURED SOURCE TREE PER
#                CONFIG -- fourteen of them, several GB in total -- so the
#                old ${TMPDIR:-/tmp} default spent that out of RAM, on top
#                of whatever the legs themselves were caged for.  Measured
#                2026-09-18: a single default-dir gate run filled a 378 GB
#                tmpfs that already held 138 GB, and every subsequent
#                command on the box failed ENOSPC -- including the ones
#                needed to clean it up.  A disk-backed default costs one
#                rsync's worth of I/O and cannot take the machine with it.
#                Override it to a tmpfs deliberately if you want the speed
#                and have measured the room.
#   FT_GATE_J    make -j per config                 (default: cores/12,
#                so nconfigs*J stays near the core count)
#   FT_GATE_SPACINGS  lock spacings to run every config at (default
#                per-node).  The two DETECTOR configs (txndbg,
#                proxyassert) carry their own 3-spacing sweep in the
#                matrix and ignore this default -- see the comment there
#                for why a defect can hide in the middle of that axis.
#   FT_GATE_REPEAT    run each leg N times (default 1).  For hunting an
#                INTERMITTENT: the two measured instances of the
#                raw-read-of-a-parked-slot class fired at ~10% and ~8%,
#                so one green leg is not evidence.  Multiplies the whole
#                matrix, hence opt-in.
#
#                ★ WHAT IT COSTS AND BUYS.  Measured 2026-08-11 on a
#                384-thread box, per-config trees already configured, with
#                the spacings running CONCURRENTLY (see run_one):
#                  * The full 14-config matrix is 383 s at N=1, and anchorval
#                    -- the only config that has ever reproduced that class --
#                    is 365 s of it, so the gate is still exactly as long as
#                    its longest swept config.
#                  * Repeats are SEQUENTIAL within a spacing while the three
#                    spacings are not, so each +1 adds one spacing's legs
#                    (~330 s), not three.  N=1 383 s, N=3 ~17 min,
#                    N=5 ~28 min.
#                  * The per-leg cost is flat across the swept axis (per-node
#                    328 s, exponential 325, root-only 328); the inv legs are
#                    83% of it (unit 55 s, ion 89, ioff 88, imw 95).
#                  * Detection per gate run: 3 inv invocations land on the
#                    ONE spacing that reproduces, so an 8%-per-run defect is
#                    seen 1-0.92^3 = 23% of the time at N=1 -- and 54% at
#                    N=3, 73% at N=5.
#                The standing default is 1: 23% per commit still surfaces a
#                NEWLY introduced defect within a few commits, and it now
#                keeps the CORE when it does (see run_one), which is what
#                makes a hit actionable rather than merely alarming.
#                ★ N=3 is now affordable in a way it was not before the
#                spacings were parallelised -- it costs ~17 min, which is
#                what N=1 cost when they ran one after another.  Raise it if
#                you would rather spend that; nothing else needs to change.
#                For a deliberate hunt prefer tests/regression/ft_corecatch.sh,
#                which repeats ONE suite with the evidence kept and no
#                build-matrix tax.

	# ★ THE CONFIG THAT ACTUALLY CATCHES THE RAW-READ CLASS.
	#
	# txndbg above arms the same engine assert and NEVER FIRES IT: with
	# ft_chain_compress_fused's raw-read defect (@f8b1640e) deliberately put
	# back, txndbg scored 0 of 144 runs -- at -O2 AND at -O1, with and
	# without the MW leg -- while this combination reproduced it.  The
	# ingredient is FEATURE_FT_ANCHOR_VALIDATE, bisected against the same
	# reverted defect on the same machine:
	#
	#   --enable-rcu-debug + ANCHOR_VALIDATE     6 / 144   (the repro)

	#   these exact CPPFLAGS                     1 /  96
	#
	# ANCHOR_VALIDATE is not an extra assert here -- it is what makes a COARSE
	# SPACING SELECTABLE AT ALL.  Without it FEATURE_FT_LOCK_SPACING_ENV is not
	# compiled in, so CDS_FT_LOCK_SPACING is never read and every leg runs
	# per-node (and cds_ft_group_attr_set_lock_spacing refuses coarse outright).
	# That, not a widened window, is why the table above reads the way it does:
	# every 0-scoring row was running per-node against an EXPONENTIAL-only
	# defect.  Hence the guard below -- a swept config without the flag is a
	# sweep that silently does not happen.
	#
	# ★ The rate is ~1-4%, so ONE run of this config proves nothing -- it is
	# here to be run with FT_GATE_REPEAT when hunting, and the 3-spacing sweep
	# is mandatory because the defect it was built from is exponential-only.

	# ★ THE PROBE-FREE COARSE-SPACING LEG -- Phase E.5's missing control.
	#
	# Every other config that sweeps the spacing axis (txndbg, proxyassert,
	# holdtrace, anchorval) carries FEATURE_FT_ANCHOR_VALIDATE or
	# FEATURE_FT_HOLD_TRACE, because until this config existed those flags were
	# the only way to make a coarse spacing SELECTABLE.  So the entire
	# certification corpus for exponential and root-only was gathered on
	# INSTRUMENTED builds, and the configuration the API gate would actually
	# ship -- a coarse spacing with no probe compiled in -- had never been run.
	#
	# FEATURE_FT_LOCK_SPACING_ENV is the knob WITHOUT the probes.  It is reached
	# through ft_lock_spacing_default() (ft-lifecycle.h), which sets the group's
	# DEFAULT and is deliberately not behind the setter's refusal -- so this
	# build selects a coarse spacing while cds_ft_group_attr_set_lock_spacing
	# still refuses one, which is exactly the shipping API contract.
	#
	# ★ WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT SEE, and that asymmetry is the point.  With no
	# DEBUG_RCU, no anchor validation and no hold ledger, this leg detects only
	# what a USER would: an invariant violation, a wrong key count, a crash, a
	# hang.  It is not a better detector than anchorval -- it is the CONTROL for
	# it, differing by exactly "-DDEBUG_RCU -DFEATURE_FT_ANCHOR_VALIDATE" over
	# the same four suites at the same three spacings.  A failure HERE is a
	# shipping-shape failure; a failure only in anchorval is a probe finding.
	# It is also the uninstrumented arm the E.4 spacing bench had to fake by
	# running its whole matrix under ANCHOR_VALIDATE for uniform overhead.
	#
	# ☠ It does NOT certify the coarse spacings.  The per-op arm refuses any
	# spacing but per-node (ft_txn_per_op_spacing_ok), so the two coarse legs
	# run the all-MW content path -- sound, and stricter, but NOT the engine
	# Phase B built.  Reading a green here as "E.5 is clear" would be reading a

	# caught by ft_unit) and a leaked lock on the commit-failure exit (a HANG
	# at ft_inv test 40 with ZERO test failures, which only the MW oracle
	# reaches).  A config that ran u alone would have shipped the second.

	# -DNO_FEATURE_FT_MERGE compiles out the merge subsystem (~20 KiB .text;
	# cds_ft_merge then returns NOT_SUPPORTED).  It had no gate config and had
	# ROTTED: the rekey fold's occupied-dst arm -- which IS a merge -- was not
	# guarded, so the library did not compile at all (9 errors).
	#
	# It was BUILD-ONLY until the 48 ft_unit tests that exercise merge
	# directly could tell "compiled out" from "broken": they now ask
	# cds_ft_merge_enabled() and skip, so the config runs the suite (295,
	# 48 of them skips) instead of only proving it links.  Compiling is a
	# weak claim about a configuration -- the rot above got in while this
	# config compiled fine.
	#
	# ft_inv joins it now that both its ordered legs are 120/120 here (the
	# last holdout, inv_ordered_bulk_consistency, was stranding its donor
	# trie's keys on the refused merge).  Running ft_unit alone is what let
	# that leak sit unseen: the unit suite never builds the concurrent
	# ordered view the leak showed up in.
	#
	# imw is armed too, and it is the leg that pays for itself here: it was
	# 112/120 when first run, with SEVEN reds -- the three
	# inv_rekey_public_atomic_no_gap* and four inv_rekey_*_writers -- all
	# reporting "no moves (livelock?)" because cds_ft_rekey_graft answered
	# NOT_SUPPORTED on this arm.  It should not have: an empty destination is
	# a GRAFT, not a union, and none of the merge subsystem is on its path.
	# The entry point was gated anyway, contradicting both its own public
	# contract and the comment on ft_rekey_spine_copy.  Un-gated; these seven
	# are the only thing that checks it stays that way.

	# ★ THE TRACING BUILD.  -DFT_ENABLE_TRACING was compiled by NO CONFIGURATION
	# AT ALL, and the cost of that is measured: the flight-recorder mis-wire
	# detector -- code that exists only in this build -- carried a defect for two
	# months (it aborted on its own torn read, @9d50ce91) because nothing ever
	# built it, let alone ran it.  A detector no configuration compiles is one
	# nobody runs.
	#
	# It RUNS the suites rather than merely building.  Compiling is the weak
	# claim -- the same lesson nomerge above records -- and it is the weaker one
	# here specifically: the detector's defect was an abort at RUNTIME on a shape
	# a green build says nothing about.  imw is in the list for the usual reason
	# (the torn read it aborted on is BY CONSTRUCTION a peer writer's), and it is
	# affordable: measured 2026-09-02, u 45 s, ion 80, ioff 79, imw 98 -- 302 s
	# sequential, inside the 365 s the swept anchorval config already costs, so

	# not decoration: cds_ft_tp.h sets LTTNG_UST_TRACEPOINT_INCLUDE to
	# "./cds_ft_tp.h", which lttng re-includes from its own header directory, so
	# "./" needs an explicit -I pointing at the directory that actually holds it.
	# It must be THIS tree's copy -- the main tree's would compile the wrong
	# headers against this config's sources.
	# @LTTNG_CFLAGS@ expands to the probed lttng-ust include flags (see the

	# lttng-ust rather than reported as a spurious CONFIG ERROR.
