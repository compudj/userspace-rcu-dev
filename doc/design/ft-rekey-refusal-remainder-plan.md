# Fractal Trie: the same-trie rekey refusal remainder -- execution plan

Status: PLAN, 2026-09-10, written at `ft/unpub-free-audit` @088ec182 for the
session that performs the changes.  Author of direction: Mathieu Desnoyers.

## 0. What this plan is, and the two decisions it rests on

`cds_ft_rekey_merge` / `cds_ft_rekey_graft` (the ATOMIC writer,
`ft_rekey_graft_simple_attempt` in `src/fractal-trie/ft-rekey.h`) still
answers NOT_SUPPORTED for 236 of the 3000 generated shapes on the default
build (rank stats on or off give the same 236).  Mathieu's position: **there
should be NO refused shapes for rekey** except `cds_ft_rekey_graft` declining
a non-empty destination (API semantics).

Two decisions frame every item below:

1. **No spine copy.**  "I don't see any need to do a spine copy anymore now
   that we have the RCU txn mechanism to atomically publish a complex mutation
   to readers."  The rekey composes its src detach edges and its dst attach
   edges into ONE flip txn; where both edits touch one node, that node is
   copied ONCE and the second edit is folded into the copy by identity
   (`@pending_pub_slot`, `@pending_dual_slot`, `@pending_del_slot`, the fold
   modes DROP / PROMOTE / REPLACE / COLLAPSE, `@old_dir_replace`).  The work is
   to make those carriers speak every encoding and shape the trie has.
2. **Analyse the code before ablating a refusal.**  "opus approach of
   removing refusal and check what breaks hit recurring walls."  For each
   item: state the SHAPE in trie terms, walk the op's steps against it from
   the code, name the step that has no owner / no fresh body / wrong encoding,
   THEN change it.  Ablation sweeps only pick a representative shape or
   confirm a derived mechanism.

Live-reader constraint (why this is harder than the cross-trie graft/merge,
which consume an EXCLUSIVE source): both sides of a same-trie move are read
concurrently, so the src drop and the dst attach land in one flip, the moved
top is COW'd (fresh address, `ft_rekey_cow_stop`), and any node both edits
rewrite gets exactly one fresh copy.

## 1. Where the 236 are (default build, exits SUM to the refused count)

| exit (ft-rekey.h unless noted) | n | family |
|---|---|---|
| `-ENOTSUP` shape gate, term `d_src.ppnf == graft_c` | 143 | W1 (83) + W2 (49) + W3 (9) + 2 |
| `-ENOTSUP` shape gate, term `climb_rest_under_graft` | 44 | W1 |
| ft-remove.h `-EDOM` ~1633 / ~1662 / ~3554 / ~3839 | 17 / 6 / 7 / 5 | W4 |
| merge dst-freshness post-loop (~3566) | 14 | W5 |

noskip: 219 refused (same families, ~3839 is 26 there).  nocompress: 12 (all
W5).  The other gate terms (`skip_compressed(graft_p)`, `d_src.pnf == graft_c
&& prep != NOSPLIT`, `climb_steps >= 2`) fire ZERO times.  The root-junction
gate fires zero times since @721e58d0.

The 187 `-ENOTSUP` shapes are ONE family: the FOLD is armed for their PLAIN
versions (served) and refused for their compressed versions by exactly two
predicates -- `!climb_compressed` in the arming (ft-rekey.h ~4047, ~4088) and
`!src_cut` / plain-node tests in `ft_rekey_fold_shape_ok` (~1339).

## 2. Standing orders for the executing session (all are Mathieu's)

* Every test, corpus run, repro and oracle runs in its own memcg:
  `systemd-run --user --scope -q -p MemoryMax=8G -p MemorySwapMax=0 -- timeout -s KILL <s> <cmd>`
  (FT livelocks allocate ~1 GB/s; a timeout is not a memory bound).  Suites
  16G.  Heavy rounds go in a `setsid nohup` driver writing a summary + marker
  file; the harness's memory guard kills background Bash bursts even at
  400+ GB free.
* Run the 17-config gate ONCE at the end, not per fix.
* Per change, the cheap checks: ft_unit + ft_inv on `bctop` (rcu-debug),
  `bctoprel` (release -O2), `b-nocomp`, `b-noskip`, `bclaim`
  (-DFT_REKEY_CLAIM), `breserve` (-DURCU_TXN_DEBUG_RESERVE); the 3000-shape
  corpus in 4 modes (rank x list) on all six; the 30000-seed rank-on run
  against the pristine control (`scratchpad/ctl`, @721e58d0 -- rebuild a
  control at the parent of your change).  A leg is green only when rc == 0
  AND ok == plan AND zero `not ok` AND zero assertion output.
* A refusal is a claim about the trie.  Lifting one needs (a) the derived
  mechanism, (b) a regression test with the shape pinned and BOTH red arms
  run (refusal restored -> NOT_SUPPORTED; fix ablated -> the corruption), (c)
  the fix shown to FIRE (tally at the arming and at the consumer).
* A classifier that names a mechanism class has named a test obligation: run
  that class on every lane that can see it -- rank stats ON (counts), list ON
  (cells), rcu-debug (owner/kind), claim (parks).  A shape whose grandparent is
  the ROOT tests nothing about grandparents (the root never compresses,
  fuses, or carries a dual): construct the below-root variant by prefixing
  every key with one or two bytes (`{xab,xabac,xccc}` was found that way).
* One adversarial skeptic per FINISHED change (Agent tool, general-purpose),
  handed the pre-built trees and a tool-call budget (~90), told to REFUTE with
  file:line or a run, default refuted on uncertainty.  Two on the last change
  each found something the corpus did not.
* `grep -i "best.effort"` the staged diff before committing; each such claim
  gets its own skeptic (CLAUDE.md).
* Commit messages carry the mechanism, the measurement and the red arms; end
  with the session's attribution lines.

## 3. Assets (all built at @088ec182 unless noted)

* Main repo builds: `bctop`, `bctoprel`, `b-nocomp`, `b-noskip`, `bclaim`,
  `breserve` (configure lines in each `config.log`).  After a source change:
  `make -j32` in the build dir, then `make -C tests/unit test_urcu_ft_unit`
  and `make -C tests/regression test_urcu_ft_inv`.  Test binaries are libtool
  wrappers (`<build>/libtool --mode=execute gdb --args ...`).
* `/mnt/data/efficios/ft-rf`: the instrumented scratch tree, synced to
  @088ec182 with line-neutral refusal tallies (`FT_TALLY(__LINE__)` on every
  refusal exit, `FT_CRUMB` on every goto), per-term tallies 21001..21005 on
  the `-ENOTSUP` gate, env ablations `ABL_MF` / `ABL_RJ` / `ABL_RJ2` /
  `ABL_NS`.  Build `bd` (rcu-debug -O1 -g -DFT_TMP_TALLY -include tally.h;
  only `src/` builds -- tests/common clashes with the force-include).  Recipe
  to re-sync after a commit: copy the four FT files from HEAD, run
  `instrument.py <root>` (in the 6e32e78b scratchpad), re-apply the hand
  edits (the python snippets in the 09-10b session log), `make -C bd/src`.
* Corpus: `rkfuzz-rank.c` (3000 deterministic shapes: `./rkf <seed0> <n>`,
  env `ALLSTATUS=1` per-seed status, `VERBOSE=1` keys, `RANK=1`, `LIST=1`;
  ☠ an EMPTY `RANK=` still counts as set -- use `env -u RANK`) and
  `rkfuzz-tally.c` (adds `EXITS=1`: one line per seed naming the tally
  counters that fired -- the per-seed exit attribution).  Link against a
  build: `gcc -O1 -g -I<repo>/include -I<build>/include -o rkf rkfuzz-rank.c
  -L<build>/src/.libs -lurcu-cds -lurcu-qsbr -lurcu-common
  -Wl,-rpath,<build>/src/.libs`.
* `sk1.c`: one-shot shape driver, `sk1 <rank> <list> <dst> <src> <key>...`
  prints status, count, verify CLEAN/RED, per-key presence.
* `sweep.sh <bin> <ABLVAR> <seedfile> <out>`: one caged process per seed,
  classifies rc (0 clean / 1 BAD / 134 abort / 137 memcg / 124 timeout).
* `final-all.sh`: the detached six-build verification round (sequential
  builds, suites one build at a time, corpus 4 legs per build, wide run).
* `N-bd.out`: the 09-10b classifier output (per refused seed: prep, cut,
  climb steps/reach/compressed, BP/rest kinds, nr_child, external_nodes).
* Memory (auto-memory dir): `project_ft_handoff_2026_09_10b`,
  `project_ft_rekey_refusal_inventory`,
  `project_ft_compressed_publish_parent_dual_unannounced`, and the feedback
  files named in section 2.

## 4. The work items, in order

### W1 -- the fold with a COMPRESSED RUN in the src chain (127 shapes; 83 DROP + 44 REPLACE/PROMOTE/COLLAPSE)

**Shape.**  The moved top S_top is the ONLY child of a compressed run R
(BP = `d_src.pnf` = R's plain compressed flag; `d_src.pdepth` = R's ENTRY
depth, set by `ft_descent_traverse_compressed`).  R hangs off `graft_c`
directly (the climb ARRIVES: t3, 83 shapes) or off a child P of `graft_c`
that survives the drop (t5, 44).  S_top may be an internal node, a run tail
or a bare external head (seed 1097 `{a, cb}` dst bccc src cb is a run over a
single head).  Representative corpus seeds (keys / dst / src):
DROP -- 1097 `{a, cb}` bccc <- cb; 1672 `{ab, b}` caba <- ab; 238 `{b, ac}`
ccab <- ac.  REPLACE/PROMOTE -- 633 `{aaac, a}` bb <- aaac; 2253 `{abc,
acac}` b <- acac; 988 `{bcca, bb}` acc <- bcca.  Prefix every key with a
byte to get the below-root variants; rank stats on for every pin.

**What the code does today (derived).**
* `ft_rekey_climb_reaches_graft` (ft-rekey.h ~1033-1120) WALKS runs on the
  NOSPLIT arm (`walk_runs`), reports `climb_compressed`, and returns
  `climb_top` = R (the last node the drop empties) and `climb_rest` (where it
  stops).  So the climb already models these shapes correctly.
* The arming (~4040-4190) refuses them at three points: the `!climb_compressed`
  term in both arming conditions; `ft_rekey_fold_shape_ok` (~1339) requiring
  the EDITED node plain (for DROP the edited node is `climb_top` = R); and the
  slot identity check `rcu_dereference(*slot) == climb_top` /
  `rcu_dereference(*dslot) == climb_top` (~4053, ~4113), which can never hold
  for a SKIP-encoded slot (a skip word names the run's CHILD, not the run).
* `ft_rekey_fold_freeze_orphans` (~1400-1520) refuses a compressed or
  skip-encoded node in the chain with FT_REKEY_UNCOVERED ("PLAIN INTERIORS
  ONLY, deliberately") and requires `nr_child == 1 && !external_nodes`.
* The CONSUMERS are already encoding-agnostic: DROP drops by SLOT ADDRESS
  (`txn->pending_del_slot = fold_top_slot`, consumed by identity in
  `ft_node_recompact`'s copy loops); REPLACE and COLLAPSE compare and store
  the RAW slot word (`fold_drop_expected`, since @3341ef69 -- "speak the
  slot's encoded word"); post-commit reclaim `ft_rekey_detach_free_orphans`
  already frees compressed orphans.
* The detach's own elevation is the model for a compressed orphan:
  ft-remove.h ~2985-3075 acquires the trailing run through
  `ft_compressed_node_flag(cn)` with its `cds_ft_item_to_metadata((struct
  cds_ft_inode *) cn)`, checks `ft_meta_nr_child_load == 1` (a compressed
  node's state word carries nr_child = 1, set by `ft_meta_nr_child_set`), and
  freezes it with `ft_detach_freeze_one` / `ft_flip_txn_record_tombstone`.
  Its upward climb steps depth by `ft_node_span` (~2744), not by 1.

**Why the stated reason for the refusal does not hold here.**  The arming
comment says a compressed link "puts a SECOND path (the SKIP_X dual) on the
same child, and refreshing that dual is a second publish this cut has no owner
for."  For DROP, REPLACE, PROMOTE and COLLAPSE nothing is REFRESHED: the slot
that held the skip word is dropped from a FRESH copy (graft_c' or P'), and the
run R and its child word both die with the retired chain.  The dual only needs
refreshing when a compressed node SURVIVES and its child is republished --
that is the compressed-publish-parent case, served @088ec182 by announcing
the reserve's dual.

**The change (what, not code).**
1. Arming: replace `!climb_compressed` by the real conditions -- the fold may
   proceed when every node the climb cleared is plain OR compressed (a run
   has exactly one child and no keys BY CONSTRUCTION, so it is always emptied
   by the drop); keep refusing a SKIP-ENCODED `climb_top` flag (never
   produced by the climb: it walks resolved flags).  `ft_rekey_fold_shape_ok`
   keeps `graft_c` plain (the fold WRITES into it) but the `edited` node may
   be a compressed run when the mode is DROP (it is dropped, not edited).
2. Slot identity: compare the node the slot DENOTES, not the word:
   `ft_flag_to_metadata(ft, *slot) == ft_flag_to_metadata(ft, climb_top)` (the
   helper resolves a skip word to its run's metadata).  Keep the RAW word as
   `fold_drop_expected` for REPLACE/COLLAPSE.
3. Freeze walk: accept a compressed node in the chain -- metadata via
   `ft_flag_to_metadata`, single-child premise from the state word
   (`ft_detach_orphan_planlock` with `require_single_child`), no
   `external_nodes` (a run cannot carry any), tombstone as the detach does.
   Depth: when the chain crosses a run whose CHILD is below it, step by the
   run's span, as the detach's climb does; for the observed shapes (R is BP,
   `pdepth` is R's entry depth) one step is one depth.
4. The freeze walk's `promoted` node stays plain (PROMOTE promotes a keyed
   plain node's head; a run has no keys).
5. Reservation: a compressed orphan costs the same tombstone record as a
   plain one; check the folded-collapse and orphan terms of the txn
   reservation (~4440-4480) still cover the chain.

**Acceptance.**  Corpus default 2764 -> ~2891 (+127), noskip +~125,
nocompress unchanged, 0 bad on all 24 legs; exits still sum to the refused
count.  Tally the arming per mode and the consumer (copy loop / replace_ptr)
to prove the modes FIRE for these shapes.  Pin in ft_unit: one DROP at
`graft_c` == root, one DROP with `graft_c` below the root, one REPLACE and
one PROMOTE with the run under a surviving child, each on both list modes and
with rank stats on for the below-root ones.  Red arms: `!climb_compressed`
restored -> NOT_SUPPORTED; the freeze walk's compressed acceptance ablated
alone -> the walk must refuse (UNCOVERED), never corrupt.  Run `bclaim`: the
freeze parks SW on the run's state word; the op must HOLD it.

**Traps.**  (a) `climb_steps` counts NODES; `d_src.pdepth` is BP's depth --
they agree only while every cleared node is one byte deep; when in doubt read
`ft_node_span`.  (b) The t3 shapes with S_top a BARE EXTERNAL HEAD go through
`glue.payload_live` (no COW of the head); the head's old parent is R -- make
sure the head's back edge is re-parented by the fold's copy loop, not left
naming R.  (c) Do NOT route these through `ft_chain_compress_fused` -- the
fold-collapse design memo already ruled that out (the fold's product is
graft_c', the collapse's is a run).

### W2 -- the fold with a CUT SOURCE and a surviving BP (49 shapes: 42 REPLACE, 7 PROMOTE, some COLLAPSE)

**Shape.**  The src key ends INSIDE a run R (`src_cut` > 0: `d_src.nf` = R,
`d_src.nf_raw` = the skip word BP holds for it); S_top' is the run's TAIL
manufactured by `ft_rekey_cow_stop(..., cut)` (~196-340: copies
`key_bytes[cut..len)` + the one child, retires R WHOLE, hands back the plain
flag).  BP = `d_src.pnf` is PLAIN, is a child of `graft_c` (t3), and SURVIVES
the drop (nr_child >= 2, or one child plus keys).  Seeds: 1413 `{bb, ac,
abaa}` c <- aba; 690 `{cbbcb, cccc}` ab <- cbb; 18 `{aabcb, abbaa}` c <-
abba; PROMOTE-like 84 `{aacca, a}` cc <- aac; 1000 `{a, aaba}` cbac <- aab.

**What the code does today.**  `ft_rekey_fold_shape_ok` refuses on
`!src_cut`; the arming comment's reason is DROP's: "the src slot holds the
RUN and S_top is a COW'd tail, so 'BP is emptied by the drop' is not the
shape at all."  True for DROP, irrelevant for REPLACE / PROMOTE / COLLAPSE,
where BP survives and the fold's product is a DEL-recompacted copy of BP
without the run's slot.  The REPLACE arm already captures the RAW word
(`dexp = d_src.nf_raw`, `dslot = d_src.nfp`) when `climb_steps == 0`.  R's
retire and post-commit free are ALREADY OWNED by `ft_rekey_cow_stop` and the
driver's `cds_ft_free_item_deferred(ft, s_top_meta)` (~6002, gated on
`!(src_cut && glue.old_dir_dropped)`) -- the fold owes R nothing.  Every key
under R passes through all of R's bytes, so a cut moves EVERYTHING below BP's
slot: dropping the whole slot is the right product.

**The change.**  Lift `!src_cut` for the REPLACE / PROMOTE / COLLAPSE arm
only (climb_steps == 0, `climb_rest` == BP); keep it for DROP.  Check
`ft_node_other_child` (COLLAPSE) and `ft_node_find_child` (REPLACE) are
handed the raw skip word (they are).  Check the count: the moved count `cnt`
is the tail's whole subtree -- `ft_rekey_move_folded` / the graft's
`count_delta` must treat a cut exactly as an uncut REPLACE (net zero on
graft_c's ancestors).

**Acceptance.**  +49 on default (and the matching noskip count), 0 bad, rank
on both list modes; pin one REPLACE and one PROMOTE cut shape (below-root
variants, rank on); red arm: `!src_cut` restored -> NOT_SUPPORTED.

### W3 -- GLUE prep, src junction is the split node's own child (9 shapes)

**Shape.**  The dst diverges INSIDE the compressed node cn that BP hangs
under (prep GLUE, `graft_c` = cn), and BP is cn's single child with one child
+ keys (PROMOTE-like) or the source is cut.  Seeds: 1227 `{ccccc, cc}` ca <-
ccc; 1911 `{bac, bacca}` bbccb <- bacc; 2890 `{a, bbbacc, bbcc}` ba <- bbbac;
2070 `{baaa, aab, baa, ac}` bacabb <- baaa.

**What the code does today.**  `glue.old_dir_replace` (ft-rekey.h ~3705-
3760, consumed by `ft_split_compressed_graft_build`'s old-direction arm in
ft-graft.h ~254-330) is armed only for `!src_cut && nr_child >= 2` (REPLACE
or COLLAPSE); `glue.drop_old_dir_of` handles the emptied case.  The 9 are the
old direction's PROMOTE (one child + keys: the head takes the slot) and the
cut variants.

**The change.**  Add the old-direction PROMOTE to the split's arm, mirroring
the fold's PROMOTE (the head IS the slot value; its back edge rides the re-
parent sweep), and admit a cut source there on the W2 reasoning.  Small; do
it after W1/W2 so their tests exist.

### W4 -- the detach-side `-EDOM` arms in ft-remove.h (35 shapes, 4 sites)

These fire AFTER the graft store, inside the (unfolded) detach; each site's
own comment names what is owed.  Verify each claim against the code before
acting -- these were read, not traced, when this plan was written.

| site | n | the comment's own account | what is owed |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~1633 `publish_parent != raw_parent` (fused collapse) | 17 | the collapse derives its publish target from a RAW back-pointer while the caller's commit re-parents that compressed node; landing on the retired copy left "one node under two parents" | resolve the publish parent read-your-own-writes through the shared descriptor (the pattern `ft_count_walk_survivor_meta` uses), or take the caller's pending re-parent as the hint |
| ~1662 `ft_glue_that_split(ctx, parent_cn)` | 6 | the collapse would absorb a node the caller's graft SPLIT, and republish at the split node's home | the merged node re-based BELOW the split point -- a different product; likely folds into W3's old-direction arms |
| ~3554 compressed `fold_pending` | 7 | the fold's pending child (the graft's cluster top) is compressed / skip-encoded; fusing would retire a never-published fresh node and re-aim its deferred edges | let the fuse absorb a compressed pending top by extending the run with its bytes and RE-AIMING the cluster's deferred edges at the merged node (glue-tracked), or canonicalize the cluster top before the fuse |
| ~3839 compressed LANDING parent after a climb with `src_held_hint` | 5 (26 noskip) | the elevated hint has no great-grandparent pair, and the compressed landing parent's SKIP_X dual needs one; deriving it raw has the staleness the hint avoids | derive `(gp, gp_slot)` for the elevated boundary from the walk that moved, coherently (`ft_resolve_parent_slot` on the boundary's metadata), and pass it in `elevated_hint` -- the same triple the NOSPLIT reserve already carries |

Seeds: 1556 `{abb, abac, b}` c <- aba (1633); 1304 `{babca, baca}` bbcaac <-
babca (1662); 1914 `{aa, cbaccc, bb, b, cccbc}` cc <- cbacc (3554); 2650
`{aa, aabc, ccc, cbb, aacbcc, bbccab}` bc <- aabc (3839).  Note ~3839 is the
NOSKIP-heavy one (26): plan its test on `b-noskip`.

### W5 -- the merge arm's dst-freshness post-loop (14 shapes; 12 on nocompress -- NOT compression debt)

**Shape.**  Occupied destination (merge), and `ft_merge_build` returns a LIVE
node as the merged top -- its `ft_merge_materialize_suffix` `suffix_len == 0`
exit returns `cn->child` (the shared-run collapse), right for a subtree,
wrong when that helper produces the merge's TOP.  Refused at ft-rekey.h
~3566 by `merged_pub == d_dst.nf || !ft_glue_is_fresh(...)` because the
rekey-coherent reader's two-descent witness needs a FRESH node at the attach
point (and the bare-head src leg rests on it).  Seeds: 1424 `{acc, cbc, ac,
b}` acc <- b; 1212 `{ca, bc, aab, ba}` ba <- aab.

**The change.**  COW the merged top when `ft_merge_build` hands back a node
`ft_glue_is_fresh` does not match -- the same re-parent-plus-retire
bookkeeping `ft_rekey_cow_stop` does for the graft arm (memory
`project_ft_compressed_stop_refusal_is_two_defects` located this).  Ablating
the gate without the COW LOSES A KEY on release (seed 712 of an earlier corpus)
-- do not lift it first.

### W6 -- pre-existing rank residue (not a refusal; record, then fix if cheap)

Seed 29976 `{b, abcbab, abcaa, abcbbb, c, bc}` abbca <- abcbab, rank stats
on: OK, keys right, `depth 2: nr_keys mismatch: stored 4, computed 3`.
Identical on the pristine @721e58d0 control.  Same family as the fused-GP
double bake (@088ec182) seen from the DETACH's -cnt walk: BP `abcb` is left
one-child and fused; graft_c `ab` is the node whose count is one too high.
Trace the two walks with an env-gated print at `ft_nr_keys_store` (the method
that found the rank lane's last four) before changing anything.

### W7 -- the gate

When W1-W5 are in (or each remaining refusal is written down as "by design"):
the full 17-config gate, from a detached driver, light configs in pairs,
heavy ones one at a time, `txndbg`'s ft_unit legs sequential per spacing
(memory `reference_ft_gate_run_heavy_configs_alone`).  `df -i /tmp` first;
delete gate dirs after reading the `.out`.

## 5. Verification recipe (per change)

```
# rebuild (each build dir):  make -j32 && make -C tests/unit test_urcu_ft_unit && make -C tests/regression test_urcu_ft_inv
# suites, caged, one build at a time (unit || inv):

# green = rc 0, ok == plan, 0 not ok, 0 assert lines on stderr; corpus = "== ran=3000 bad=0", served count, exits summed
# wide:  ./rkf-<build> 1 30000 with RANK=1, both list modes, and the SAME on the control build; diff the BAD seed sets
# per-seed exit attribution:  EXITS=1 ./I-<build> (rkfuzz-tally.c against the ft-rf instrumented build)
```

Before the commit of each item: one skeptic on the finished diff; the
best-effort grep; the commit message with mechanism, numbers, red arms.

## 6. Traps already paid in this area (do not pay again)

* A release-only measurement reads an unowned SW park as "served"; run
  rcu-debug AND `bclaim`.  Rank stats ON masks one owner assert and exposes
  the count walks; test legs need OPPOSITE attributes.  `||` between test legs
  hides the second one -- accumulate with `|=`.
* `ft_node_find_child` compares RAW words: pass the encoded word a slot
  HOLDS, reason about the node it DENOTES.
* The count walk follows retired chain levels to their SURVIVOR; a fused
  collapse maps 2-3 levels onto one run, and the middle level FALLS THROUGH
  (no record at its slot).  Charge a body once per walk (identity set,
  @088ec182).
* `pending_pub_slot` / `pending_dual_slot` are single fields: check no two
  producers can fire in one op before adding a producer.
* A refusal inside a BUILD helper can only answer -EAGAIN, and a
  deterministic shape then re-plans for ever: structural refusals answer
  FT_REKEY_UNCOVERED at PLAN time (`ft_rekey_fold_freeze_orphans`'s two-kinds
  rule).
* The 3000-seed corpus rarely produces a fusable non-root grandparent (first
  at seed ~9744); CONSTRUCT below-root shapes by prefixing keys.
* A `RANK=` that is empty still selects rank stats; `env -u RANK`.
* The `#ifdef FEATURE_FT_COMPRESS return false` class: a guard on a BUILD is
  never a shape argument; look for the value the guard is really protecting.
